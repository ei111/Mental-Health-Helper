Connect with a Friend: Reach out to someone you like talking to, even if it’s just a quick message. Do Something You Enjoy: Engage in a hobby or activity you find relaxing or fun. Practice Gratitude: Write down or think of a few things you’re grateful for. Watch or Read Something Uplifting: Find a funny video or read a favorite book. I hope these help."

Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your lungs expand, then slowly exhale through your mouth, releasing any tension. Continue this deep breathing, focusing on the rhythm of your breath. As you breathe, bring your attention to your body, starting at the top of your head and working your way down. Visualize a warm, soothing light relaxing each part of your body. Let go of any tension with each exhale. Now, picture a place where you feel completely at ease and happy, whether it’s a real location or from your imagination. Immerse yourself in this place, enjoying the sights, sounds, and sensations. Feel the joy growing within you. Repeat to yourself: “I am worthy of happiness and joy. Today, I choose to focus on the positive aspects of life. I embrace the good things in my life and am grateful for them. I am confident, capable, and ready to make today a great day.” Allow these affirmations to fill you with a sense of calm and positivity. I hope this helped you."

Sarah's sleep is all messed up; she wakes up a lot during the night and has trouble falling back asleep. She feels down and thinks she’s not good at anything, and she’s worried about what the future holds. Sarah also doesn’t have much of an appetite and doesn’t enjoy things she used to like. Her job is very stressful, and she’s been getting a lot more work recently. She’s also having a hard time with her partner because of how she’s been feeling. Even though Sarah doesn’t use drugs or alcohol, her family has a history of feeling sad. Sarah decided to get help after feeling really overwhelmed and having thoughts of hurting herself. When doctors checked, they found that Sarah was very stressed and sad. To help her feel better, Sarah will see a therapist who can help her change how she thinks and give her ways to handle stress. The doctors are also thinking about giving her some medicine to help with her feelings. Sarah is encouraged to stay active, like going for walks or playing sports, and to try relaxing activities to reduce her stress. They will keep checking in with her to see how she’s doing and make any changes to her plan if needed.",

Let go of any tension with each exhale. Now, picture a place where you feel completely at ease and happy, whether it’s a real location or from your imagination. Immerse yourself in this place, enjoying the sights, sounds, and sensations. Feel the joy growing within you. Repeat to yourself: “I am worthy of happiness and joy.

I am confident, capable, and ready to make today a great day.” Allow these affirmations to fill you with a sense of calm and positivity. I hope this helped you."
